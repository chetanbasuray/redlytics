Redlytics grabs a Reddit user‚Äôs most recent posts and comments (up to ~1000 of each) and generates a beautiful, interactive dashboard with summary statistics, activity visualizations, karma analysis, and much more.

## ‚ú® Features

Redlytics provides a wide range of analytical insights, all presented in a clean and responsive dashboard:

üìä **Comprehensive Stat Cards**

- Total Posts, Comments, and combined Karma.
- Average karma per post and per comment.
- Estimated account age in days.
- Total awards received on recent content.
- Most and least active hours of the day.

üìà **Interactive Charts & Visualizations**

- **Activity Analysis:** Interactive bar charts showing user activity by day of the week and hour of the day, with a toggle for local timezone or UTC.
- **Historical Trends:** Line charts visualizing user activity and average content score over the entire time period for which data is available.
- **Karma Breakdown:** A modern doughnut chart showing the proportion of karma earned from posts versus comments, with the total karma count displayed in the center.
- **Top Subreddits by Karma:** A horizontal bar chart identifying which communities are the user's biggest sources of karma.
- **Comment Length Distribution:** A bar chart showing if the user tends to write short, medium, or long comments.

üß† **Content & Language Analysis**

- **Dynamic Word Cloud:** A visually engaging word cloud of the user's most frequently used words, with word size and color indicating frequency.
- **Comment Highlights:** A showcase of the user's highest-voted ("Best") and lowest-voted ("Worst") recent comments.
- **Language Detection:** Identifies the primary languages used in posts and comments, complete with flags.
- **Flair Detection:** Scans all activity to find and display a list of all unique flairs the user has across different subreddits.

üèÜ **Awards Showcase**

- A dedicated section that displays all unique awards the user has received on their recent content, complete with icons and counts. (This section only appears if awards have been received).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Navigate to **[redlytics.vercel.app](https://redlytics.vercel.app/)**.
2. Enter any valid Reddit username (without the `u/` prefix).
3. Click "Analyze User".
4. Wait a few moments while Redlytics fetches and processes the data.
5. Explore your interactive dashboard!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with modern, browser-native technologies, requiring no complex build setup.

- **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (via CDN)
- **Charts & Visualizations:** [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)
- **API Proxy:** [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions)

## üîß Running Locally

Because this project uses a Vercel Edge Function for its API proxy, the best way to run it locally is with the Vercel CLI.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

3. **Install the Vercel CLI (if you don't have it):**

    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    ```

4. **Run the local development server:**

    ```bash
    vercel dev
    ```

5. Open your browser and go to the local address provided (usually `http://localhost:3000`). The server will automatically run the Edge Function, allowing the application to work just like it does in production.

## üí° How It Works

1. **Data Fetching:** When a username is submitted, the application makes requests to its own internal API endpoint (`/api/reddit-proxy`).
2. **Vercel Edge Proxy:** This endpoint is a Vercel Edge Function that runs on Vercel's global network, close to the user. This function receives the request, securely fetches the data from the public Reddit API, and streams it back to the browser with the correct CORS headers. This ensures fast and reliable data fetching from anywhere in the world.
3. **Client-Side Analysis:** Up to 1000 posts and 1000 comments are fetched. All data processing and analysis happens directly in your browser using JavaScript.
4. **Caching:** To improve performance and reduce API load, results for a specific user are cached in-memory for 5 minutes. Analyzing the same user within this window will load the data instantly.
5. **Rendering:** The analysis results are passed to React components which use the Recharts library to render the interactive dashboard.
